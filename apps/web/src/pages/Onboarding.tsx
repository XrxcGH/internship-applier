/**
 * What one edit does to the review list. The whole of G1's clearing rule lives here.
 *
 * A flag clears only when the field now holds an answer. Any onChange used to clear it,
 * including a change BACK to the unanswered value. The work-authorization select exposes its
 * "Select…" placeholder as a real option, and home city and state accept an empty string, so
 * a user could satisfy three of the six facts G1 exists to collect by touching a control and
 * undoing it, then confirm a profile whose location and work authorization were still blank.
 * G1 only means something if it checks the value rather than the interaction.
 *
 * An optional wizard field is the exception: its blank is a real answer, so re-flagging one
 * left empty would trap a person who has nothing to put there.
 *
 * `raise: false` is the education editor, where re-flagging is the wrong half of the rule
 * rather than the whole rule being wrong. The six facts are flagged from the moment the
 * profile is built, so raising one back always restores a flag that was there. An education
 * field is not: most are never flagged at all, and coursework, a field of study and a
 * graduation date are all optional on the profile shape, so putting a flag on a school the
 * extractor was happy with because someone cleared a date they never had invents work at a
 * gate that blocks on its list being empty. The opposite must not happen, and does not: a
 * GPA flag the extractor DID raise stays raised until a real number is behind it, whatever
 * gets typed into the boxes in between.
 *
 * That is the whole of the rule for a field that is EMPTY on both sides of the edit. It said
 * nothing about a field going from full to empty, and that gap was a false red one keystroke
 * wide: a student who filled the GPA in, cleared the flag, and then typed "4.32 weighted"
 * into the box beside it lost the number with no flag to show for it. So a caller may pass
 * `raise` per edit, and the GPA boxes do exactly that on the keystroke that empties them —
 * see `editGpaBox`.
