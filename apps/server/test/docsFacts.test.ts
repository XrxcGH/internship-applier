/**
 * The documents, checked against the code instead of against a memory of the code.
 *
 * README.md said "505 tests" for four commits after the suite had passed a thousand, and
 * docs/04 described a "16-family taxonomy" that had grown to 21, a `resolveCompany` domain
 * fallback that was never built, and a stage-2 fingerprint built from `normalizeTitle` when
 * the code had moved to `fingerprintTitle`. Every one of those drifted silently because
 * nothing in apps/server/test, apps/web/test or packages/shared/test opened a .md file, so
 * a wrong number in a document cost nothing until a reader believed it.
 *
 * The rule this file follows: a countable claim in a document is asserted against whatever
 * in the code DETERMINES the number, never against a second copy of the number. Where the
 * value is exported it is imported and measured; where it is a module-private constant the
 * declaration itself is matched, so moving the constant is what breaks the test rather than
 * a paraphrase in the prose.
 *
 * One claim is deliberately absent: the size of this test suite. Counting the tests from
 * inside the tests is circular, it would fail on every commit that adds a case, and a
 * green-but-meaningless assertion is worse than no assertion. The README no longer states
 * a test count at all — it points at `npm test`, which answers the question honestly at the
 * moment it is asked — and the first check below is what keeps a number from creeping back.
