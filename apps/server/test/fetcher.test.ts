/**
 * robots.txt, and what happens when a host will not hand one over — docs/04 § Politeness.
 *
 * RFC 9309 § 2.3.1 gives three different answers for three different failures, and the
 * fetcher collapsed them into one: anything that was not a 200 fell into the same
 * catch-and-carry-on as a DNS failure, cached an empty disallow set for the life of the
 * process, and read as "nothing here is off limits". A site in a maintenance window served
 * 503 for its robots.txt and had its whole careers section crawled — including, once the
 * maintenance ended, the paths it had been disallowing all along.
 *
 * These run against real local servers rather than a stubbed `fetch`, because the thing
 * under test is what the fetcher does with a status code it was handed, and a stub would be
 * the test asserting its own assumption about how the request is made. Each case gets its
 * own server, so each gets its own origin — the robots cache is keyed by origin and lives
 * for the life of the process.

 * and no hop cap on its destination. A host answering `301 Location:
 * http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags` got this process to issue an attacker-chosen GET inside the
 * user's own network; `Location: https://www.linkedin.com/...` got it to fetch a board this
 * tool refuses to open, from the student's own address.
 *
 * Redirects are still followed — a site moving its robots.txt to `www` is ordinary, and
 * refusing outright would read as a complete disallow and quietly stop reading that employer.
 * They are followed one at a time, with every hop checked.
