/**
 * Who is allowed to touch the browser, and when.
 *
 * Three defects, one root: the run registry had no mutual exclusion around its ASYNC setup.
 * Every check it did make was correct about the moment it ran and wrong about the seconds
 * either side of it.
 *
 *   1. `continueRun` guarded on `run.state === 'filling'`, but a continue spends its first
 *      several seconds in `detectIntervention` and `buildFormMap` with the state still
 *      reading `reading`. Two continues inside that window both reached `executePlan`,
 *      against one page and one keyboard — and `insertText` types into whatever has focus,
 *      so one run's approved essay lands in the box the other just clicked into, on a real
 *      employer's form, in the user's name.
 *   2. `startRun` registered its run and THEN awaited `openSession`. A second start found
 *      `session` still undefined, so the discard closed nothing, deleted the entry, and
 *      registered its own — leaving the first launch's BrowserContext attached to an object
 *      no longer in `runs`, unreachable by discard, by shutdown, and by the close delete-all
 *      does before removing the profile directory it is still holding a lock on.
 *   3. Every run launches against one shared Chromium profile directory, so two applications
 *      cannot be filled at once — but nothing said so, and the second failed on the profile
 *      lock as a 502 carrying a raw Playwright message about a directory.
 *
 * The browser is mocked because none of this is about a browser. It is about what happens in
 * the gaps between awaits, and a real Chromium makes those gaps untestable.
