/**
 * The loop between resolving a company and planning a run, over the wire.
 *
 * `queryPlanner` states that a Workday target enters the plan only through an actual
 * resolution, "which arrives here in knownBoards", and docs/04 repeats it. Nothing built
 * that route: knownBoards comes from `source` rows, and the only writer of those is
 * `ensureSource`, which fires once per PERSISTED POSTING inside a run. So a resolved board
 * became a plan target only if the user retyped it into the run list by hand, ran it, and
 * that run came back with at least one posting — and for Workday, whose adapter searches
 * for "intern", a board resolved outside internship season legitimately returns nothing and
 * could never enter a plan at all, while the plan's own note told the user to go and
 * resolve the board they had just resolved.
 *
 * These go through `app.inject` rather than calling the route bodies, because the defect
 * was in the wiring between two routes and reading either one alone showed nothing wrong.
 * `globalThis.fetch` is replaced, so no test here reaches the network.
