/**
 * A resolution, written down, because that is the only way one reaches a plan.
 *
 * `queryPlanner` says a Workday target enters the plan only through an actual resolution,
 * "which arrives here in knownBoards", and knownBoards is built below out of `source` rows.
 * Nothing created a source row from a resolution: `ensureSource` fires once per PERSISTED
 * POSTING inside a run, so a resolved board only became a plan target if the user re-typed
 * it into the run list by hand, ran it, AND that run came back with at least one posting.
 * For Workday, whose adapter searches for "intern" by default, a board resolved outside
 * internship season legitimately returns nothing and could therefore never become a plan
 * target at all, while the planner's own note told the user to "resolve it in Discover to
 * find the right board" for the board they had just resolved.
 *
 * Only boards that positively answered are written. `resolveCompany` no longer reports a
 * vendor whose answer proves nothing, so this cannot mint a row for a board that is not
 * there — which is the thing that would make it worse than the gap it closes.
 *
 * A board with nothing posted today is written down too, and that is deliberate: it is the
 * case this exists for. A run only ever created a row for a board that returned postings,
 * so the boards that could not reach a plan were exactly the quiet ones, and a company's
 * ATS does not stop being its ATS between seasons. The cost is a plan chip that finds
 * nothing until the board fills; the chip names its board, and the source can be switched
 * off in Settings.
 *
 * The select-then-insert is `ensureSource` again, in the one other place that needs it;
 * that function is private to run.ts. Two resolves of the same name racing would write the
 * label twice, as they would through run.ts, and the planner dedupes on `source:board`.
