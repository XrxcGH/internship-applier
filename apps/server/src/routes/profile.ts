 * deleted that job. The answer kept its green tick, kept an evidence panel citing
 * `experience.0` while `experience` was empty, and the fill planner went on offering the
 * sentence as something to type into the employer's form. G3 is supposed to mean "a human
 * checked this against the profile"; after that edit it meant "a human checked this against
 * a profile that no longer exists". Every trigger that re-ran verification was a change to
 * the ANSWER — a redraft, a user edit, an explicit unapprove — and there was no trigger at
 * all on the other side.
 *
 * Only answers that FAIL lose their stamp. Blanket-invalidating everything on any profile
 * write would be simpler and would be its own small cruelty: correcting a postal code would
 * send the user back through a dozen answers that were never in question. The check is the
 * same deterministic pass the approve route runs, so an edit that touches nothing an answer
 * relies on turns nothing over.
 *
 * Answers on an application the user has already sent are left alone. That text reached the
 * employer; marking it "not approved" afterwards would be the tool telling a story about
 * something it cannot change, on a card whose only honest state is what was submitted.

 * calls this on the profile it just saved rather than growing a second copy of the rule.
 *
 * It used to return early on an unconfirmed profile, on the reasoning that an unconfirmed
 * profile cannot have produced an approval. That is true of a profile that was never
 * confirmed and false of the one case where it mattered: a re-extraction resets `confirmedAt`
 * to null on a profile that HAD been confirmed and whose approvals are still on the answers,
 * so the guard switched the sweep off at exactly the door it was exported for. Nothing
 * false-green ever reached an employer — `load()` in routes/filling.ts catches that path
 * before a key is pressed — but between the re-upload and the next fill attempt the review
 * screen showed a green tick beside an evidence panel quoting a profile that no longer
 * existed, and the user had no reason to look again.
 *
 * A never-confirmed profile still costs nothing here: no answer can carry `approvedAt`
 * without a confirmation having happened, so the loop below skips every row.
