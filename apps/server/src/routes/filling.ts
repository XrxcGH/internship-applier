   * than the truth, and docs/03 states the accurate version.
   *
   * Two things make that more than a slogan. The body must actually say `confirmed: true`,
   * and the application must be somewhere the status model allows `submitted` to follow
   * from. Neither used to be checked. Any bare POST that reached this URL — a double-click,
   * a retry after a dropped connection, a client firing on the wrong row — stamped
   * `submitted` on whatever it found, including a draft with no form filled and not one
   * answer approved, and the user was then looking at a board that said they had applied
   * somewhere they had not. All of G4 rests on a person saying they did it, and the server
   * was taking nobody's word for anything, because it never asked. The sibling /status route
   * has enforced the same state machine all along.
