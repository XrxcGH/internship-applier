/**
 * Where model calls go — see docs/14-model-access.md.
 *
 * Two backends sit behind one interface:
 *
 *   `claude_cli` spawns the user's own installed `claude` binary. The CLI handles its
 *   own authentication, so this process never reads, stores, or transmits a credential.
 *   That distinction is the whole point: Anthropic prohibits using a Claude subscription's
 *   OAuth token inside another product, and this design has no way to do that even by
 *   accident. There is no code path here that opens ~/.claude.
 *
 *   `api` uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY against the Anthropic API, billed per token.
 *
 * Everything that is not drafting or resume extraction works with NEITHER. Discovery,
 * matching, eligibility, FactGuard, StyleCritic, and the tell-scrub are all deterministic.
 * A missing model is a reduced tool, not a broken one, and `describeAccess` says so.

 * Why a model call could not be made — and it is NOT always "no access".

 * One class carried seven different situations, and callers could only re-render its message
 * or fall back to advice about signing in. The web-search source did the latter, so a CLI run
 * that TIMED OUT told the student to sign in to a CLI they were already signed in to, and
 * said the live web "is not searched" without saying that the search had in fact started and
 * run out of time. The advice named a cause that was not the cause and prescribed an action
 * that would change nothing.
 *
 *   `unavailable`     no CLI on PATH and no key — the genuine no-access case
 *   `not_signed_in`   the CLI is installed and has no credentials
 *   `no_key`          the API backend was selected with no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
 *   `usage_limit`     the subscription's cap was reached; it comes back on its own
 *   `timed_out`       the call was still running when the per-call ceiling expired
 *   `cli_error`       the CLI exited non-zero or reported an error of its own
 *   `unreadable`      it answered in a shape this app could not parse
 *
 * The first three are the ones where "set up model access" is the right thing to say. The
 * rest are failures of a working setup, and telling someone to fix their setup is wrong.
