/**
 * The Claude Code CLI as a model backend — docs/14-model-access.md.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A Claude Max subscription is not an API key, and Anthropic explicitly
 * prohibits using a subscription's OAuth token inside another product. So this backend
 * does the one thing that is not that: it runs Anthropic's own client as a subprocess on
 * the user's own machine. The CLI authenticates itself. This process never reads
 * ~/.claude, never handles a token, and never talks to api.anthropic.com.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR: a personal tool, run locally, by the person whose subscription it is.
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: a way to ship software that borrows other people's subscriptions.
 * docs/14 says so next to the policy text.
 *
 * THREE CONSTRAINTS SHAPE THE INVOCATION, and they are not obvious:
 *
 *   1. `--bare` cannot be used. It skips credential discovery and then demands an
 *      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, which is exactly what we do not have. Tools/skills/MCP are
 *      disabled with `--allowedTools` instead.
 *
 *   2. Long text cannot go on the command line. Windows caps a command line near 8191
 *      characters and our prompts carry an evidence block plus writing samples. The
 *      system prompt goes to a temp file via `--system-prompt-file`; the user content
 *      goes on stdin, which the CLI reads as input data.
 *
 *   3. `--system-prompt-file` REPLACES Claude Code's default prompt rather than appending
 *      to it. That is what we want: the default frames the model as a coding agent
 *      working in a repository, which is the wrong voice for a job application.
