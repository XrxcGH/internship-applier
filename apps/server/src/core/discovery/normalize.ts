// ---------------------------------------------------------------- work arrangement

/**
 * Postings say "no remote" in far more ways than they say "remote".
 *
 * The negation used to be three literal phrases checked *inside* the plain-"remote" branch,
 * so "Remote work is not available for this position" and "this is not a fully remote role;
 * you will be in office 5 days" both came back as `remote`. For anyone who had turned remote
 * off, eligibility then filtered the posting out and told them "This posting is remote and
 * you have remote turned off." — the exact opposite of what the posting says — and everyone
 * else saw the row labelled "Remote" with its real city thrown away.
 *
 * A denial has to land ON the arrangement, which is a question of grammar and not of
 * distance. The leading form used to be any "no"/"not" within forty characters of the word,
 * so "We do not have an office - this is a remote position", "No relocation support for this
 * remote position" and "There is no fixed schedule for remote team members" were all read as
 * onsite: a genuinely remote posting labelled with the opposite of what it says, ranked lower
 * for it, and shown to the user with a sentence about commuting from their home city. So the
 * negation must either sit against the word with nothing but articles, intensifiers and the
 * other arrangements of a list in between ("not a fully remote role", "no remote or hybrid
 * options"), or attach to a verb that puts an arrangement on the table ("we do not offer
 * remote work", "this position is not eligible for remote work").
 *
 * The window still stops at clause punctuation, so a negation in one sentence cannot cancel a
 * genuine remote offer in the next: "Fully remote. You will not be required to relocate."
 * stays remote. The trailing forms list the words that actually deny an offer, because a bare
 * "not" after "remote" is usually something else entirely — "this role is remote and is not
 * restricted to any state" is an offer, not a denial.
 *
 * Both arrangements are built from one template deliberately. The two lists were written out
 * separately and drifted: hybrid never learned the "unavailable" spelling that remote knew,
 * so "hybrid is unavailable" was read as an offer of hybrid. Anything added here has to hold
 * for every arrangement the word can stand in for.

 * passing "remote work may be possible later" beat "this position is onsite in Austin", which
