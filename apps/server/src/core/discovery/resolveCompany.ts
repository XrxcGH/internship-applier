 * Nothing here writes to the database; the caller does. `routes/discovery.ts` turns each
 * resolution into a `source` row, which is how a resolved board reaches the query planner,
 * and that row used to appear only once a discovery run had pulled postings off the board.
 * Caching the mapping so a second resolve is a single request is not built, so resolving
 * the same company twice re-probes every vendor.
 *
 * The whole resolve is bounded: five GET probes plus at most six Workday POSTs per slug
 * candidate, and `slugCandidates` yields at most three candidates, so one resolve tops out
 * at 33 requests. The bound is stated because the Workday probe below could grow without
 * one, and an unbounded probe is a crawl wearing a resolver's name.

 * A 200 is not by itself evidence that a board is there, and treating it as one is how a
 * phantom board reached the user. Probed live against all five GET endpoints with names
 * that are not companies ("zzqqwwxxnotacompany", "qqq-www-eee-not-real", "acmewidget"):
 *
 *   greenhouse       404 {"status":404,"error":"Job not found"}
 *   lever            404 {"ok":false,"error":"Document not found"}
 *   ashby            404 Not Found
 *   workable         404 Not Found
 *   smartrecruiters  200 {"offset":0,"limit":1,"totalFound":0,"content":[]}
 *
 * So four vendors say no by saying 404, and a 200 from them carries the board's own shape
 * (an array of jobs) whether or not anything is posted — `{"name":"Stripe","jobs":[]}` from
 * Workable is a real account with nothing open, and that is worth returning. SmartRecruiters
 * is the one vendor that answers 200 for every id there is, and it gives nothing to tell a
 * company with no board apart from a board with nothing posted: `Ubisoft` and `McDonalds`,
 * both real SmartRecruiters companies, answer `totalFound: 0` exactly as the invented names
 * above do, and there is no company-level endpoint to ask instead (`/v1/companies/{id}`
 * is 404 for real and invented ids alike). Only `totalFound > 0` is evidence there.
 *
 * That costs a real SmartRecruiters board with nothing posted today, which the file's other
 * rule — a board with zero jobs is still returned, because it answers which vendor the
 * company uses — would otherwise keep. It is the right way to lose: the alternative returned
 * a SmartRecruiters board for EVERY name typed into Discover, including names of companies
 * that do not exist, and an invented board is a fact the student cannot check. The loss is
 * said out loud in `notes` rather than swallowed.
