 * match: the same live tenant that answers 919 for "intern" answers 1779 for "prácticas"

 * or French internships. Spending a shared row budget on them read a board of 189 rows that
 * held 9 internships where the single "intern" search had read 200 that held most of the
 * board's real ones. What is precise on one API is noise on the other, so only the title
 * vocabulary is shared between them.
 *
 * The list is deliberately shorter than `internshipShaped` reads. A word in the filter costs
 * nothing; a word here costs one request per board per run, so only the words that earn a
