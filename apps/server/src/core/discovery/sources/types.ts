 * The same three tag-removing passes the regexes did, without the backtracking.

 * one: at every `<` the `[^>]+` runs to the end of the input looking for a `>`, fails, and
 * gives back one character at a time. Measured before the rewrite on a body that is simply
 * the character `<` repeated — 10 KB took 61ms, 20 KB 221ms, 40 KB 909ms, 80 KB 18.3 SECONDS.
 * Repeated `<script` and `<meta ` behave the same way. A one megabyte page, which any host
 * can serve and nothing here caps, is minutes.
 *
 * It matters because this is pointed at whatever a fetch returned: a careers page the model
 * named, a link pasted into the manual box, a `description` on an open feed anyone can post a
 * row to. Node is single-threaded, so for the whole of that time the server does nothing else
 * — not the health check, not the event stream, and not a fill run standing on a real
 * employer's form. No timeout can end it either, because a timeout needs the event loop too.
 *
 * THE PASSES STAY IN THIS ORDER AND SEPARATE, which a first attempt at this did not, and 1,150
 * of 20,000 generated documents came out different. Removing `<br>` BEFORE the general tag
 * pass is what stops a stray `<` swallowing it: in `a < b<br/>` the general pass would
 * otherwise read `< b<br/` as one tag and take the line break with it. Each pass here does
 * exactly what its regex did, one scan at a time instead of by backtracking.
