/**
 * Aggregator sources and the community internship list — docs/04 § Tier A.
 *
 * Adzuna and USAJOBS both need a free API key. When one isn't configured the adapter
 * reports itself unconfigured and the run summary says so explicitly, rather than
 * quietly contributing nothing — an invisible gap in coverage reads as "we searched
 * everywhere" when we didn't.
 *
 * Those notes name the .env file because that is where the keys are read from. They used to
 * say "in Settings", and Settings has no key field and no mention of either source: the one
 * place a user finds out why federal internships were missing sent them looking for a box
 * that does not exist, with no second instruction to fall back on.
 *
 * Arbeitnow and Remotive need no key at all — both publish documented public JSON endpoints
 * — but "documented" is not the same as "welcome", and nobody had asked either host. Both
 * were fetched through fetchJson, which defaults `isDocumentedApi: true` and so skips the
 * robots.txt check outright; fetchJson's own docstring calls that default "a convenience,
 * not a claim about the URL". remotive.com/robots.txt carries `Disallow: /api/*` and
 * `Disallow: /*search=`, and the URL this file built was matched by both, so the tool was
 * reading a path the site asks automated clients to leave alone. docs/04 § Politeness is
 * what a user reads to believe this tool obeys robots.txt, so both keyless adapters now go
 * through the robots-respecting path and let each host's own file answer: Arbeitnow's allows
 * the feed, Remotive's refuses, and a refusal is reported as a plain gap in the student's
 * words rather than as a source that searched and found nothing.
 *
 * Unlike the two keyed sources they are firehoses of every seniority, so each filters
 * to internship-shaped rows before normalizing and says in its notes how many rows the
 * filter dropped. Without that count a run that read four hundred jobs and kept three would
 * look like a source that was barely consulted.
