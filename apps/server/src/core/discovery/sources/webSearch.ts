/**
 * Tier B: the live web, searched through the user's own model access — docs/04 § Tier B.
 *
 * This is the tier that was "designed, not built" for the whole life of the project, and the
 * reason the tool needed URLs pasted into it: Tier A reads boards the user already knows
 * about, and nothing searched for the ones they did not. The `web_search` kind sat reserved
 * in the shared enum with no adapter behind it.
 *
 * HOW IT KEEPS THE SOURCING POLICY, which is the part worth reading twice. The model does not
 * scrape anything: on the CLI path it uses Claude Code's WebSearch tool and on the API path
 * the server-side web-search tool, so Anthropic's own search infrastructure runs the queries.
 * The model's answer is a list of CANDIDATE URLs and nothing more — every page it names is
 * then fetched by this process through `fetchManualPosting`, the same polite,
 * robots-respecting, JSON-LD-reading path a hand-pasted URL takes. What gets stored is what
 * the employer's own page says, never what the model claims. A page whose robots.txt refuses
 * us is refused, counted, and reported.
 *
 * LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Glassdoor and the like are excluded twice: the prompt tells
 * the model to return the employer's own posting instead (nearly every aggregator listing is
 * a repost of an ATS page this tool reads legitimately), and `siftCandidates` drops any that
 * come back anyway, out loud. Their terms prohibit automated reads, and this repo's promise
 * not to make them is enforced by tests.

const SYSTEM = `You are the search step of a local tool that helps one student find internships. A human reviews everything downstream; your job is only to find candidate posting pages.

SWEEP, do not take one pass. You have several searches available and the student is relying on this to replace the browsing they would otherwise do by hand. Vary the angle between searches rather than rephrasing one query:
- the role terms with the term and year ("summer 2027 software engineering internship")
- each location in the brief, and again for remote
- recency ("posted this week", "now hiring", "applications open")
- the kinds of employer a student would not think to search for by name: startups, national labs, research groups, non-profits, mid-size firms — not only the famous ones
- the roles a student's own background would suit, not only the exact words of the brief

Rules:
- Every posting must be OPEN NOW. Skip anything closed, filled, or for a past term.
- Return the EMPLOYER'S OWN application page: their careers site, or their page on boards.greenhouse.io, jobs.lever.co, jobs.ashbyhq.com, *.myworkdayjobs.com, jobs.smartrecruiters.com, or apply.workable.com.
- NEVER return links to LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Handshake, or any other job aggregator. Those sites refuse automated reads. But their listings are still USEFUL TO YOU: when a search result is an aggregator listing, it names the employer and the role — search again for that employer's own posting of the same job and return THAT. This is how the student gets the postings they would have found on those sites.
- Only return URLs you actually saw in search results. Never construct or guess a URL: a plausible-looking link that 404s wastes a fetch, and an invented one is worse.
- Prefer variety across employers over many roles at one employer.
- Fewer real ones beat more doubtful ones.`;

 * How many candidate pages one run will fetch.
 *
 * Each candidate is a real HTTP fetch of somebody's careers page, rate-limited per host, so

 * raises it past the ceiling.
 *
 * Raised from 10/15. The model already sweeps several angles in one call, so the old cap was
 * throwing away most of what it found — a live run named 15 pages and was allowed to read 6,
 * and the note apologising for the other 9 was the tier's most common output. The point of
 * this source is to replace an evening of browsing job boards by hand; a sample of six does
 * not. The fetches are sequential and per-host rate-limited, so the ceiling is what keeps
 * that from becoming a burst at anybody's careers site.
