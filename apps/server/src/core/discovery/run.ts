 * The source row for a label, looked up every time on purpose.

 * everything" in Settings truncates the source table, and foreign keys are on — so the first
 * discovery run after a delete handed the job_posting_source insert an id for a row that no
 * longer existed and the whole run died on "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed". The user saw a 500
 * from a search, or a 502 saying "Could not read that URL" about a URL that had been fetched
 * and parsed perfectly, and it happened on every run until someone restarted the process. The
 * delete reply says "Restart the app to begin again", but that is advice and the app keeps
 * running.
 *
 * The lookup it replaces is one indexed hit on a table with a handful of rows, a few times per
 * run. Cached state that outlives the database it describes is not worth that.
