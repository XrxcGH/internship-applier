/**
 * The application status model — docs/11 § M7.
 *
 * ONE RULE SHAPES THIS FILE. The tool may move an application forward only as far as
 * `awaiting_submit`. Everything from `submitted` onward is the user reporting what
 * happened in the world, because the tool never submitted anything and has no way to know.
 * That is gate G4 extended into the tracker rather than a separate policy.
 *
 * `ghosted` is the exception in the other direction: it is DERIVED, never set. An employer
 * does not send a rejection you can record. Silence past a threshold is what it is, and
 * calling it a status the user has to click would be asking them to declare their own
 * rejection.

   * had answered today and the application could never be worked out as ghosted at all.
