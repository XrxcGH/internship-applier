/**
 * Job description → structured requirements — docs/05 § Stage 0.
 *
 * Two passes, deliberately in this order:
 *
 * 1. DETERMINISTIC. Regexes for the unambiguous phrasings ("must be 18 years or older",
 *    "we do not provide sponsorship", "graduating between December 2027 and June 2028").
 *    These are higher precision than a model on exactly the clauses that carry the most
 *    consequence, they cost nothing, they are unit-testable, and they mean the whole
 *    matching pipeline works with no API key configured.
 *
 * 2. LLM. Everything the regexes didn't catch, with `strict` structured output.
 *
 * Both passes go through the same two guards before anything is persisted:
 *   - the quote must literally appear in the description (quoteGuard);
 *   - the value must validate against the per-kind schema (requirementValues).
 * A quote that is not in the posting is discarded outright. A value that does not validate
 * is kept, but as `other`/`unclear`, which no rule can fail anyone on. Neither is taken at
 * face value — an invented requirement could wrongly disqualify the user.

 * How far either side of a match these windows may reach.

 * and a performance one.
 *
 * CORRECTNESS FIRST, because it is the worse half. `start` was "just after the last full stop
 * or newline at or before the match", which on a description containing NEITHER is position
 * zero. `sentenceAround` then returns `slice(start, end).trim().slice(0, 400)` — the first 400
 * characters of the document. So for a posting written as one long unpunctuated line, the quote
 * stored as the EVIDENCE for a requirement did not contain the requirement: a student ruled out
 * for being under 18 was shown "We are hiring interns for many teams this year..." as the reason
 * they were ruled out. `verifyQuote` cannot catch it, because that text really does appear in
 * the posting. Bounding the lead means the match is always inside the quote.
 *
 * That shape is not exotic. `stripHtml` turns a run of `<li>` into lines with no terminal
 * punctuation, and boards that emit one `<p>` for the whole description produce exactly it.
 *
 * The performance half: an unbounded `slice` is O(n) per match with the match count itself
 * rising with the length, which is the same quadratic this file already fixed once by another
 * route. Measured with no full stop and no newline anywhere — 22KB took 46ms, 44KB 143ms, 88KB
 * 571ms and 176KB 2.3 SECONDS, a clean four times per doubling.
 *
 * 240 rather than 400 so that the match still fits inside the 400-character cap `sentenceAround`
 * applies afterwards, and generous enough that no ordinary sentence is clipped by it.

  // hand. It contains "without sponsorship" and was read as a refusal, so a posting that
  // went out of its way to invite people who need a visa was hidden from precisely those
  // people, under a sentence claiming sponsorship was unavailable printed next to the
  // employer's own words saying the opposite. The `without` branch stays, because
  // "authorized to work in the US without sponsorship" is a genuine refusal and just as
  // common.
  //
  // The check reads the handful of characters immediately in front of the match rather
  // than anything clause-scoped: what makes this an invitation is the "with" on the far
  // side of the "or", and nothing further out changes the answer. Only the offending match
  // is skipped — a posting can carry both an inclusive line and a real refusal.
  //
  // Half the employers write this with "sponsorship" as the noun ("we do not offer
  // sponsorship") and half with "sponsor" as the verb ("we do not sponsor work visas"),
  // so both need their own branch. The verb branch used to be spliced into the noun one,
  // where it could only ever have fired on the string "sponsor sponsorship" — meaning
  // "we cannot sponsor visas", "we will not sponsor applicants for work visas" and
  // "does not sponsor H-1B visas" all produced no work-authorization requirement at all,
  // and a student who needs a visa was shown a posting whose first line rules her out.

- Only extract requirements the posting actually states. Do not infer a requirement from a job title or from what is typical for this kind of role.
- necessity: "required" for hard requirements, "preferred" for nice-to-haves, "unclear" when the wording is ambiguous. When in doubt use "unclear" — it is treated as non-blocking.
