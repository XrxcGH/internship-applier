 * Hard eligibility rules — docs/05 § Stage 1.
 *
 * THE most consequential module in this system. A false `ineligible` silently costs the
 * user an opportunity they'll never know existed, so every rule here is:
 *
 *   - pure, with the clock injected, so it is exhaustively testable;
 *   - tri-state — `unknown` is a first-class outcome, never rounded to `fail`;
 *   - obliged to cite evidence for every `fail` (a test enforces this).
 *
 * No model decides any of this. The LLM's only job upstream was to extract requirements
 * and quote them; the judgement is plain TypeScript over structured fields.
