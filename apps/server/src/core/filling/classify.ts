/**
 * Field classification — docs/07-form-automation.md § Classification.
 *
 * Turns "what is this input?" into a `FieldSemantic`. Two stages were specified, cheap
 * first, and only the first of them exists:
 *
 *   1. This file. A rule table over the normalized label + name + id + autocomplete.
 *      Free, instant, unit-testable, and it handles the large majority of real fields.
 *   2. Not built. docs/07 § Classification specifies an LLM fallback over the fields stage 1
 *      cannot name, returning its own semantic and confidence. Until it exists, a field
 *      stage 1 does not recognize stays `unknown` and is handed back to the user, which is
 *      the safe half of that design and the reason its absence is not urgent.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF CHECKS IS THE DESIGN. Redlines are consulted before anything else, so a
 * field can never be classified into something fillable and then filled — a mislabeled SSN
 * box is refused before the question "is this a text field?" is even asked.
 *
 * WHY `autocomplete` WINS. When a form says `autocomplete="family-name"` it is telling us
 * what the field is, in a standard vocabulary, on purpose. That beats any guess made from
 * prose. Regexes only run when the attribute is absent or unrecognized — or, in the single
 * case spelled out at NOT_A_MAILING_ADDRESS, when the label is asking about someone's
 * origins and the token can only describe where they get their post.
 *
 * UNRECOGNIZED IS A REAL ANSWER. Anything below the confidence floor is treated as
 * `unknown` by the planner, left blank, and surfaced for the user. A wrong guess in a job
 * application is worse than a blank the user fills in themselves, so this file never
 * reaches for a default.
