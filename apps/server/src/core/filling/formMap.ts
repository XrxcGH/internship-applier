/**
 * Reading a page into a FormMap — docs/07-form-automation.md § Building a FormMap.
 *
 * The whole page is read before anything is typed. That ordering is deliberate: it means
 * the redline pass and the "what is unknown here?" question are both answered while the
 * form is still untouched, so a run can be abandoned without having half-filled it.
 *
 * WHERE THE LABEL ACTUALLY LIVES. Six places, in descending reliability, because real ATS
 * forms use all of them and several use different ones on the same page:
 *
 *   1. `aria-labelledby` pointing at an element  (explicit, and survives restyling)
 *   2. `<label for=...>` or a wrapping `<label>` (the standard)
 *   3. `aria-label`                              (explicit, common in component libraries)
 *   4. a preceding sibling's text                (the ATS div-soup pattern)
 *   5. the enclosing container's own first text  (worse, but still better than nothing)
 *   6. `placeholder`                             (weakest; often an example, not a name)
 *
 * Extraction runs inside the page rather than over a serialized DOM, because resolving a
 * label means walking the tree — through open shadow roots — and reading computed style,
 * and shipping the whole document back to Node to do that would be slower and lossier.

   * perfectly good rect and Playwright considers it visible, so the tool typed into it.

   * — "email", "website" — precisely so a classifier recognizes them. Filling one is how
   * a form decides you are a bot.
   *
   * THE CHECKS HAVE TO WALK UP THE TREE, because none of the properties that hide a field
   * have to be set on the field itself. `getComputedStyle` does not inherit `opacity`, so a
   * honeypot inside `<div style="opacity:0">` reported opacity 1, a full-size rect and
   * `visibility: visible` — it passed every test here, was classified "Email Address" at
   * 0.97, and had the applicant's real address typed into it. The same for a wrapper with
   * `height: 0; overflow: hidden`, which clips its children away without touching their
   * rects. Both are as common a honeypot as `left: -9999px`, and because nothing re-reads
   * the label at fill time (see `locatorFor` below) the run signed off "ok" over a form
   * that had just flagged the applicant as a bot.
   *
   * AND THE TREE IT WALKS IS THE COMPOSED ONE, host by host, not the light DOM alone.
   * `parentElement` is null at the top of a shadow tree, because a ShadowRoot is a document
   * fragment and not an element — so the walk simply stopped there and every control inside
   * an open shadow root, at any depth, skipped all of these checks. The same two honeypots
   * wrapped in a custom element came back "Email address" at 0.97 with nothing above them

 *
 * A radio group is one question with several answers, but the scanner sees N independent
 * inputs — and when the label resolver reaches the fieldset's legend, all N carry the
 * same question as their label. That produced N fields with identical semantics, each
 * ticked in turn, the last one silently unticking the rest, and read-backs recorded for
 * choices that were no longer selected. Whether the tool had ticked "Yes" or "No" was
 * decided by document order.
 *
 * Grouped, the question is the field and the buttons are its options, so choosing means
 * matching the intended value against each button's own text.
