 * typed into their own profile was not a fact the gate could check an answer against: on a
 * resume of sixteen activities with three bullets each, twenty of those bullets were outside
 * the corpus, and `I raised the entry fees through the Calloway boosters` came back from
 * approval as `409 UNVERIFIED_CLAIMS: "Calloway" does not appear anywhere on your profile`.
 * It appears on their profile. There is no override at G3, and the remedy the message offers
 * had already been done.
 *
 * Truncation was never a fabrication defence, which is why asking for everything is safe:
 * every item in the corpus is a fact the profile already holds, and the checks that catch
 * invention — names, dates, GPAs, durations, offices — are exact rather than lexical.
 *
 * This asks for everything and now GETS everything, which it did not always. `retrieveEvidence`
 * used to clamp whatever it was handed to its own `MAX_EVIDENCE_ITEMS` of 60, so the value
 * below bought sixty facts however large the ask and the false red above simply moved from
 * forty facts to sixty. That ceiling now bounds only a caller that states no preference, and
 * an explicit limit is honoured: on the sixteen-activity fixture in filling.route.test.ts,
 * limit=80, limit=200 and MAX_SAFE_INTEGER each returned 60 items of 66 before that change and
 * return all 66 after it. If a later edit puts a ceiling back over an explicit limit, the
 * approval on `Ran the Pemberton fundraiser for Art Club.` in that suite is what goes red.
 *
 * One constant rather than a number written twice, because the two gates have to ask for the

 * asked for, so a sentence cannot pass one gate and fail the other over corpus size alone.
