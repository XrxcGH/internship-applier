/**
 * Answer drafting — docs/06 § ② and ③.
 *
 * The pipeline for one form question:
 *
 *   retrieve evidence → draft → scrub tells → FactGuard → (revise once, if blocked)
 *
 * Three things about this design are deliberate.
 *
 * FIRST, the model never sees the profile. It sees the bounded evidence set from
 * `retrieve.ts`, each item tagged with a ref. It is told, plainly, that facts outside
 * that set do not exist. This is what makes FactGuard's verdicts meaningful rather than
 * decorative — a claim can only be "supported" by something that was actually supplied.
 *
 * SECOND, the voice instructions are MEASUREMENTS, not adjectives. "Sentences average 14
 * words but swing by 9" produces a different result from "write naturally", because the
 * second is what every model already thinks it is doing. The user's own writing goes in
 * as few-shot examples for the same reason.
 *
 * THIRD, the revision loop runs at most once. A model asked repeatedly to fix its own
 * fabrications will eventually produce something that satisfies the checker without being
 * true. One pass, then the flags go to the user at G3 and a person decides. That is the
 * whole point of the gate.

const HARD_RULES = `
FACTS
- Everything you write must come from the EVIDENCE block. Facts that are not there do not exist for this task.
- Do not add numbers, dates, durations, company names, job titles, technologies, or metrics that the evidence does not state.
- Do not upgrade what the evidence says. "Helped with" is not "led". "Contributed to" is not "owned". Two months is not "a year".
- If the evidence cannot answer the question, write the most honest short answer it supports and stop. A thin true answer is the correct output; a padded one is not.
- Write in first person, as this person.

WHAT NOT TO WRITE
These constructions get flagged automatically and will be sent back:
- Openers: "I am writing to express my interest", "I am excited to apply", "As a passionate", "In today's fast-paced".
- Words: delve, leverage, utilize, robust, seamless, spearheaded, meticulous, tapestry, testament, pivotal, myriad, plethora.
- Stock intensifiers: "truly", "incredibly", "deeply passionate", "profound".
- The "It's not just X, it's Y" reframe, and its cousin "More than X, it's Y".
- Rule-of-three lists used for rhythm rather than because there are three things.
- A closing sentence that restates the paragraph, or that tells the reader what they should conclude.
- Paragraphs of near-identical length, and sentences that all run 15-20 words.
- Anything that sounds like an assistant talking about the person instead of the person talking.

Write the answer and nothing else. No preamble, no headings, no sign-off.`.trim();
