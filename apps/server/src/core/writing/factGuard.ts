/**
 * FactGuard — docs/06 § ④.
 *
 * The reason this tool is safe to point at a job application. Every claim in a draft is
 * checked against the evidence set the draft was built from; anything that cannot be
 * traced is flagged and blocks approval at gate G3.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, and the order matters:
 *
 *   1. DETERMINISTIC (this file, no model). Durations, GPAs, organisation and institution
 *      names, and skills are extracted from the draft and compared to the evidence. These
 *      are the highest-consequence errors and the ones a model is least reliable at
 *      catching in its own output — "I worked there for two years" when the profile says
 *      three months is a factual claim with a right answer, not a judgement call. No API
 *      key required and fully testable, so the adversarial suite runs on every commit.
 *
 *   2. MODEL (advisory) — BUILT AND TESTED, BUT NOT WIRED IN. Semantic claims the regexes
 *      cannot reach: "I led the migration" when the evidence says "helped with the
 *      migration". `mergeModelVerdicts` below implements the merge policy — the model may
 *      downgrade a verdict, never clear one — and the adversarial suite covers it, but no
 *      production path calls it. Neither `draftAnswer` nor the G3 route produces model
 *      verdicts today, so nothing at runtime ever emits a claim with decidedBy: 'model'.
 *
 *      Said plainly because the alternative is a comment that describes a check the user
 *      is relying on and that does not run: semantic overstatement is caught by the human
 *      at G3 and by nothing else. docs/06 and docs/11 say the same.
 *
 * TWO FAILURE DIRECTIONS, weighted deliberately. A missed fabrication is worse than a
 * spurious flag — but only just. A guard that lights up every other sentence trains the
 * user to click through warnings, which destroys its value entirely. So each check below
 * fires only when it can point at something specific, and the checks that cannot be made
 * precise (durations with no named employer) are deliberately permissive.
