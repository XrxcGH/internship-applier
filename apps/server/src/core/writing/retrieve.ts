/**
 * Evidence retrieval — docs/06 § ① Retrieval, not invention.
 *
 * Facts come out of the profile carrying a `ref` that points back at where they came from.
 * Two consumers read them, and they want opposite things:
 *
 *   - the drafting prompt wants few, because a smaller prompt drafts better and every
 *     draft and revision pays for it. `formatEvidence` bounds that side;
 *   - FactGuard wants ALL of them, because every sentence it sees has to be traceable to
 *     one of these items and a fact that was never supplied cannot be "supported" — so a
 *     fact left out here is, at gate G3, something the student never did.
 *
 * `retrieveEvidence` therefore returns the corpus and `formatEvidence` prints the prompt.
 * They were one number for a long time, and the number was the guard's problem.
 *
 * Deterministic: keyword and skill overlap, no model call, no embeddings yet.

  // +0.1, a bullet +0.15 and a certification +0.05 — so on a generic question, where no

  // restatement of something the profile holds:
  //
  //   "I am certified in First Aid/CPR/AED through the American Red Cross."
  //   "I built Trail Tracker, a trail-condition map for the county park system."

  // The trade-off chosen here is that the VERIFICATION corpus and the DRAFTING prompt are
  // no longer the same thing. FactGuard has to see everything the profile holds or a true
  // sentence about a held fact is red with no override, while the prompt drafts better
  // small — so `formatEvidence` bounds what the model reads and this set stays whole. The
  // price is real and is worth naming: a bigger corpus is a bigger token union for
  // FactGuard's lexical coverage score, which nudges a few vague fabrications from red to
  // amber. That is the right direction to spend on. Retrieval truncation was never a
  // fabrication defence — every item here is a fact the profile actually holds, and the

/**
 * The evidence block as the drafting prompt sees it.
 *
 * Bounded, and separately from the corpus above. The retrieved set is sized so FactGuard
 * can never call a held fact invented, which on a busy resume means it is larger than a
 * prompt wants — and a fatter prompt drafts worse and costs more on every draft and every
 * revision.
 *
 * TAKING THE HEAD OF THE ARRAY WAS NOT ENOUGH, and the reason is the same base-score
 * ordering the selection above already had to work around. The array is round-robin over
 * entries, but the buckets come out ordered by their best item, and a bare role line scores
 * +0.3 while a school scores +0.25 and a certification +0.05. On the resume this was found
 * with — twenty-seven activities, twenty-six of them carrying no bullets at all — the first
 * twenty-four lines were twenty-four bare "Title at Org (dates)" strings. The eleven honors
 * and four certifications, which on that profile are the ONLY substance it holds, were in
 * the corpus and never in the prompt: the model was asked to write about a person and shown
 * nothing they had done.
 *
 * So the prompt is filled by round-robin over KINDS, in the order below, taking one line
 * from each in turn. Experience leads because it is what most questions ask about; identity
 * is pulled out and always first, since a draft that cannot use the writer's own name or
 * city gets those blocked at G3. Within a kind the order is untouched, so it stays the
 * relevance order the retrieval built.
 *
 * Facts below the line are not lost, they are only unwritten-about: the student can still
 * state them themselves at G3 and the guard will recognise them, because the corpus that
 * guard reads is the whole set rather than this slice.
