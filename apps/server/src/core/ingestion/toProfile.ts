 * it is the schema's documented "still there" (packages/shared/src/profile.ts), so a
 * finished nine-month school-store job written "2024-09 to June 2025" was stored as
 * ongoing, measured to today, and a draft claiming two years at that store came back
 * `supported` with the entry quoted beside it as proof. The same silence on a
 * certification date pushed a true sentence the other way: with "2023" dropped, "I have
 * served as a CPR certified responder for three years" was measured against the longest
 * JOB on the profile and blocked at G3 as overstated, where there is no override.
 *
 * So a date is read as the window of months it names, and the window is what the callers
 * below reason about:
 *   `month`      — the resume named one month, however it spelled it. Nothing is lost.
 *   `window`     — a year or a season names a range, not a month.
 *   `ongoing`    — "Present" and its synonyms mean exactly what an absent end date means.
 *   `absent`     — nothing was stated, which is a legitimate answer.
 *   `unreadable` — something was stated and it names no date at all.
 *
 * `ranged` says the field held a whole range — "Aug 2026 - May 2030" — and this file picked
 * the half the field asked for. The month is the resume's, but the decomposition is ours, so
 * it goes to G1 exactly like a year or a season does.

   * at all. Every count on the G1 screen was a number, so nothing looked wrong: "Experience —
   * 27 entries" beside "Skills — none found". What it actually meant is that the retrieval
   * step had twenty-seven titles and no description of anything the person did, so any
   * sentence about the work itself would be refused at G3 — which has no override — while
   * `inferRoleFamilies` read an empty skills list and planned a narrower search than the
   * resume warranted.
   *
   * One aggregate flag each rather than one per entry. Every one of those entries was already
   * flagged for its own missing start date, and twenty-seven "I have checked this" clicks is
   * how a gate stops being read.
   *
   * `lostTheEvidence` is the threshold, and it lives in @ia/shared because the G1 screen shows
   * the paragraph explaining what it costs and the two must not disagree about one profile. It
   * is deliberately not "every entry is bare": the resume this was written for had twenty-seven
   * entries carrying ONE line between them, which an exact-zero test reads as fine. `skills`
   * fires on a resume that produced something, since a document with neither education nor
   * experience has bigger problems and gets flagged for them.
