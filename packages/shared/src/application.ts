   * are the same six characters, and the label is all the classifier gets — so a row of the

   * confidence, verified by read-back and shown in the review as a field that went right.
   * That is a false statement about their work history in a form submitted in their name. The
   * rules can only disqualify the phrasings that name the container out loud ("Previous
   * employer start date"); a bare column heading needs to know what it is a column of. The
   * same gap makes repeated rows indistinguishable from one another, which is why every row
   * of a repeated table currently receives the same profile value.
