# 09 — API

Fastify, bound to `127.0.0.1` only. JSON over REST, plus one SSE stream. Request bodies are
validated with Zod schemas from `packages/shared`, so the frontend and backend can't drift.

**This document was rewritten against the routes that exist.** It previously described three
endpoint groups that were never built and a dozen paths under names they do not have. Every
row below was read out of `apps/server/src/routes`; anything unbuilt is marked as such
rather than listed as if it worked.

**Auth:** none — loopback-only, single user, single machine. A random per-run token is
required in an `X-App-Token` header on every `/api/*` route except `/api/health` and
`/api/session`. The frontend fetches it from `GET /api/session` (`apps/web/src/lib/session.ts`),
not from Vite or the served `index.html`. What that token is and is not worth is set out
honestly in docs/10 § Data in transit: it stops a stray page in another tab, and it does not
stop a local process, which could read `data/app.db` directly anyway.

Errors use a consistent envelope:

```jsonc
{ "error": { "code": "PROFILE_NOT_CONFIRMED", "message": "…", "details": {} } }
```

## Session & health

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Liveness, runtime version, uptime, table count, profile state. No token needed. |
| `GET` | `/api/session` | Hands the UI its `X-App-Token`. No token needed, by necessity. |

## Profile & documents

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/profile` | Current profile including `derived` and `needsReview`. |
| `PUT` | `/api/profile` | Update fields. Recomputes `derived`. Does **not** confirm. |
| `POST` | `/api/profile/confirm` | **G1.** Rejects with `PROFILE_INCOMPLETE` while `needsReview` is non-empty. Sets `confirmedAt`. |
| `POST` | `/api/profile/reviewed/:path` | Clears one `needsReview` entry the wizard has no dedicated control for. |
| `POST` | `/api/resumes` | Multipart upload. Returns `{ documentId, filename, mime, sha256 }`. Extraction is a separate call, not a task. |
| `GET` | `/api/resumes` | List documents. |
| `POST` | `/api/resumes/:id/extract` | Read the document into a draft profile. Returns `{ profile, needsReview }`. |
| `POST` | `/api/resumes/:id/primary` | Set the default resume for applications. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/resumes/:id` | Delete the row and the file, and promote the newest remaining resume if this was the primary. |

## Writing voice

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` `POST` | `/api/writing-samples` | List and add samples. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/writing-samples/:id` | Remove one. |
| `POST` | `/api/style-profile/compute` | Recompute `StyleProfile` from the current samples. |
| `GET` | `/api/style-profile` | Metrics plus the plain-language summary shown in the UI. |
| `GET` | `/api/answer-library` | The reusable answer library. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/answer-library/:id` | Remove a canonical answer. |

> **Not built:** `PUT /api/answer-templates/:id` and `POST /api/answer-templates/:id/approve`.
> The library is read and delete only; entries are added by approving an answer at G3.

## Discovery

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/sources` | Configured sources with health and last run. |
| `GET` | `/api/sources/available` | Every adapter the server knows, and whether it has a key. |
| `PUT` | `/api/sources/:id` | Enable, disable, or reconfigure one. |
| `POST` | `/api/discovery/plan` | Returns the planned targets for review. Runs nothing. |
| `POST` | `/api/discovery/run` | Runs the plan. Progress via SSE; the summary is returned when it finishes. |
| `GET` | `/api/discovery/runs` | Recent run summaries. |
| `GET` | `/api/discovery/runs/:id` | One summary: per-source counts, errors, skips, duplicates. |
| `GET` | `/api/discovery/stats` | Posting counts by source and freshness. |
| `GET` | `/api/postings` | The raw posting table, for inspection. |
| `POST` | `/api/discovery/manual` | Body: `{ url }`. The paste-a-URL path — fetch, normalize, store one posting. |
| `POST` | `/api/companies/resolve` | Body: `{ name }` → detected ATS and board slug, by probing the three keyless vendors. |
| `POST` | `/api/discovery/refresh` | Re-check open/closed and deadlines across the table. |
| `POST` | `/api/postings/:id/refresh` | The same, for one posting. |

## Matching

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/matches` | Filterable list with posting summary, score, breakdown and badges. |
| `GET` | `/api/matches/:id` | Full detail: posting, requirement checklist with quotes, blockers, breakdown, rationale. |
| `POST` | `/api/matches/:id/decision` | Body: `{ action: 'approved'\|'skipped'\|'rejected'\|'saved', reason?, reasonTags? }`. `approved` creates an `application` and returns its id — it does **not** submit anything. |
| `POST` | `/api/matches/recompute` | Re-run matching after a profile change. |

## Applications & answers

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/applications` | List with answer and blocked counts. |
| `GET` | `/api/applications/:id` | Detail: status, answers with evidence and flags, model access. |
| `POST` | `/api/applications/:id/questions` | Add a question to answer. (There is no form-analysis endpoint; questions are entered or come from the fill run's form map.) |
| `POST` | `/api/answers/:id/draft` | Draft one answer. Redrafting is the same call. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/answers/:id` | Update the text; recomputes edit distance and re-runs FactGuard. |
| `POST` | `/api/answers/:id/approve` | **G3.** Rejects with `UNVERIFIED_CLAIMS` while a blocking flag remains, and with `PROFILE_INCOMPLETE` if there is no confirmed profile to check against. |
| `POST` | `/api/answers/:id/unapprove` | Withdraw approval. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/answers/:id` | Remove a question and its answer. |
| `GET` | `/api/model-access` | Which backend is available and what it can do. |
| `POST` | `/api/model-access/test` | Round-trip the backend. Answers 200 with `ok: false` on failure, so the detail survives. |

> **Renamed since this doc was first written**, listed so old references resolve:
> `/api/applications/:id/analyze` → `/api/applications/:id/questions`;
> `/api/applications/:id/answers/draft` → per-answer `/api/answers/:id/draft`;
> `PUT /api/answers/:id` → `PATCH`; `/api/answers/:id/regenerate` → the same `/draft` call;
> `/api/cost` → `/api/costs`; `/api/answer-templates` → `/api/answer-library`.

## Filling & submission

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/applications/:id/fill` | Rejects with `PROFILE_INCOMPLETE` without a confirmed profile, and `ANSWERS_NOT_APPROVED` if any answer lacks `approvedAt`. Streams steps over SSE. Answers **409** `FILL_BROWSER_BUSY` while a different application has the browser open, and `FILL_IN_PROGRESS` while this one is already opening. |
| `GET` | `/api/applications/:id/fill` | The current run: filled fields, read-backs, skips, and why. |
| `POST` | `/api/applications/:id/fill/continue` | Resume after a pause (login wall, needs-input). Answers **409** `FILL_IN_PROGRESS` while a call is already driving the page — one caller at a time, claimed before the first await rather than from the run's state, which lags several seconds behind. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/applications/:id/fill` | Abandon the run and close the browser. |
| `POST` | `/api/applications/:id/mark-submitted` | **G4.** Records that the user submitted it. Requires `{ confirmed: true }` — rejects with `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` without it, and `ILLEGAL_TRANSITION` from a status the model does not allow `submitted` to follow. |
| `POST` | `/api/applications/:id/status` | Manual status transition with an optional note. |

There is deliberately **no** `POST /api/applications/:id/submit`. The server has no code
path that clicks a submit control; docs/07 § G4 sets out how that is enforced.

One correction to what this section used to say. `mark-submitted` is **not** the only writer
of `submitted_at` — `/status` also writes it when the user moves an application to
`submitted`. Both are user-initiated, so G4 holds, but "the only endpoint" was false, and the
same false claim sat in the schema comment.

The `{ confirmed: true }` body is real and enforced. It was declared in the shared schema
and read by nothing for a while, which made the one machine-checkable half of G4 decorative:
any bare POST — a double-click, a retry after a dropped connection, a client firing on the
wrong row — stamped an application submitted. The route now parses the body and applies the
same transition check the status route does.

> **Not built:** a `dryRun` flag on `/fill`, and `GET /api/applications/:id/presubmit`.
> The pre-submit review is served by `GET /api/applications/:id/fill`.

## Cost & privacy

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/costs` | Token and spend rollups by purpose, read from the `llm_call` ledger. |
| `GET` | `/api/privacy/export` | Full JSON export of everything stored, decrypted. |
| `GET` | `/api/privacy/delete-preview` | What would be destroyed, with real counts. |
| `POST` | `/api/privacy/delete-all` | Requires `{ confirm: 'delete everything' }`. Wipes every table, the files, the browser profile, and the key. |

> **Not built:** the whole Settings group (`GET`/`PUT /api/settings`,
> `POST /api/settings/keys`), the Browser-session group (`/api/browser/*`), and the Tasks
> group (`/api/tasks*`). Settings are environment variables; browser sessions live in the
> Playwright profile directory; discovery reports its own progress rather than exposing a
> task queue.

## Events (SSE)

`GET /api/events` — one long-lived stream, `text/event-stream`.

```ts
type AppEvent =                                                              // publisher?
  | { type: 'extraction.progress'; documentId: string; stage: string; pct: number }      // none
  | { type: 'discovery.progress'; runId: string; source: string; found: number; new: number | null }
  | { type: 'discovery.source_failed'; runId: string; source: string; error: string }
  | { type: 'discovery.done'; runId: string;
      summary: { sources: number; found: number; new: number; duplicates: number;
                 errors: number; skipped: string[] } }
  | { type: 'match.new'; matchId: string; score: number }                                // none
  | { type: 'draft.progress'; applicationId: string; questionId: string; stage: string }
  | { type: 'fill.step'; applicationId: string; field: string; status: 'ok'|'mismatch'|'skipped'|'failed'; note?: string }
  | { type: 'fill.needs_input'; applicationId: string; reason: 'login'|'captcha'; detail: string }
  | { type: 'fill.done'; applicationId: string; filled: number; mismatched: number; failed: number; skipped: number }
  | { type: 'task.failed'; taskId: string; kind: string; error: string };                // none
```

Three of those members have **no publisher at all** — `extraction.progress`, `match.new` and
`task.failed` are declared and nothing ever sends them; `packages/shared/src/events.ts` marks
each one. Two more details the shape above now states rather than glosses: `discovery.progress`
carries `new: number | null`, and null is the only value the runner currently sends, because
how many are new is not known until every source has been fetched — zero has to keep meaning
zero. And `discovery.done`'s `summary` is its own small object, **not** the `RunSummary` the
`/runs` endpoints return, so a consumer reading `summary.bySource` or `summary.closed` off the
stream gets `undefined`; the run summary proper comes back in the POST response.

`fill.needs_input` has exactly two reasons. `unknown_field` was removed from the schema
outright — `packages/shared/test/events.test.ts` asserts the schema rejects it — because the
screen that renders these treats "not login" as "bot check", so a third reason would have told
the user to solve a challenge that is not on the page.

Each event carries a monotonic `seq`, and a heartbeat comment goes out every 20s to keep the
connection alive. The stream is served and the events are published; **the frontend does not
consume it yet** — there is no `EventSource` anywhere in `apps/web/src`, and each screen
refetches instead. Reconnect-and-replay from `Last-Event-ID` is therefore untested.

`fill.needs_input` never carries `reason: 'unknown_field'`. `detectIntervention` is the only
thing that builds an intervention and it returns `login`, `captcha` or nothing at all — a
field the classifier cannot place is skipped and listed in the pre-submit review, which is
not a reason to stop and hand the browser back. It matters because the review screen treats
every reason that is not `login` as a bot check, so a run halted on `unknown_field` would
tell the user to solve a challenge that is not on the page.

## Server-side invariants

Enforced in the route layer, above the core modules:

1. `/api/discovery/*` and `/api/matches/*` reject with `PROFILE_NOT_CONFIRMED` while
   `confirmedAt` is null, via an `onRequest` hook on each of those two route modules.
   **This is narrower than it used to claim.** There is no blanket guard: `writing.ts`,
   `tracker.ts` and `privacy.ts` have none, and the fill and approve routes enforce the same
   idea themselves with a different code (`PROFILE_INCOMPLETE`). Those two are the ones
   where an unconfirmed profile would produce wrong output rather than an empty screen.
2. `/fill` rejects unless every answer for the application has `approvedAt`.
3. `/answers/:id/approve` rejects while an unresolved `unsupported` or `overstated` flag
   exists, and refuses outright when there is no confirmed profile to check against — a
   check that cannot run is not a check that passed.
4. `submitted_at` is written only by a user action: `mark-submitted` or a `/status`
   transition to `submitted`. No fill or drafting path can write it.
5. Decrypted 🔒 fields are returned on the profile route, the export route, and as
   `readBack` on the fill-run routes. **The last of those used to be left out**, which made
   this read as a stronger promise than the code keeps: `serializeRun` puts the value read
   off the page into every field result, so `GET /api/applications/:id/fill` and both POST
   variants return the decrypted name, email, phone and address. That is not a leak — same
   local user, loopback-only, the same values the profile route already returns — and it is
   the point of read-back verification, which is worthless if the value read back does not
   come back. Date of birth is never included in a fill plan, whatever a form field is
   classified as.
